So, this is very offtopic from what I normally blog about (programming stuff,
sysadmin stuff, etc). I'll be posting about a project I've been working on
for Fedora Hosted soon.

But for now, here goes. I'm just trying to do some people a favor ;).

I've been on a bit of a How I Met Your Mother spree lately. Towards the end of
season 7, I started getting really hooked on the show. I had seen bits and
pieces of the show, but not in order until then.

However, season 7 recently ended and in my few bits of free time, I've started
watching the show back from season 1. In fact, I may or may not have become
a bit addicted to the show.

In any case, there's a particular piece of music that is played in some
episodes that I recognized from somewhere, some video game, even, and I just
couldn't place it. I did a lot of Googling, and finally found a
[YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBp-lGjGUxY) which has comments
with where the song was from. It was from the old classic: Super Mario
Brothers 2.

[The main/overworld theme.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9s4fuOL3FM)

This probably isn't a comprehensive list, but this song at **least** appears
in:

* Season 7, Episode 3 (Ducky Tie) at 3:10
* Season 5, Episode 19 (Zoo or False) at 9:30

So there you have it. I saw a few comments throughout my Google journey, where
people were also trying to identify the song. Hopefully this will help.
