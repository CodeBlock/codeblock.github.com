    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, this is very offtopic from what I normally blog about (programming stuff,
sysadmin stuff, etc). I&rsquo;ll be posting about a project I&rsquo;ve been working on
for Fedora Hosted soon.</p>

<p>But for now, here goes. I&rsquo;m just trying to do some people a favor ;).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bit of a How I Met Your Mother spree lately. Towards the end of
season 7, I started getting really hooked on the show. I had seen bits and
pieces of the show, but not in order until then.</p>

<p>However, season 7 recently ended and in my few bits of free time, I&rsquo;ve started
watching the show back from season 1. In fact, I may or may not have become
a bit addicted to the show.</p>

<p>In any case, there&rsquo;s a particular piece of music that is played in some
episodes that I recognized from somewhere, some video game, even, and I just
couldn&rsquo;t place it. I did a lot of Googling, and finally found a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBp-lGjGUxY">YouTube video</a> which has comments
with where the song was from. It was from the old classic: Super Mario
Brothers 2.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9s4fuOL3FM">The main/overworld theme.</a></p>

<p>This probably isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive list, but this song at <strong>least</strong> appears
in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Season 7, Episode 3 (Ducky Tie) at 3:10</li>
<li>Season 5, Episode 19 (Zoo or False) at 9:30</li>
</ul>


<p>So there you have it. I saw a few comments throughout my Google journey, where
people were also trying to identify the song. Hopefully this will help.</p>
