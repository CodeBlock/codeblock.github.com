    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first met Seth on IRC in June of 2010 when I joined the Infrastructure team.
From the very start, I admired his ability to say what he feels about something
without holding back. He was always able to tell someone how amazing or how bad
their idea was, in relation to something else. This made him very unique.
He was always very good at explaining his thought process, as well. He never
failed to have real, valid reasons for thinking so strongly about something. It
was never a blind emotion.</p>

<p>He was extremely caring. This past Fudcon, a small group of us went to get
dinner, and I was particularly quiet because I was tired. He turned to me and
asked, very genuinely, &ldquo;Are you okay? You look like something is bothering you.&rdquo;
He was always that way, and if someone needed help with something, he would
drop what he was doing to go help them.</p>

<p>He was a very productive person. Always on IRC, even in the early morning hours
with me sometimes, whenever I needed help with something I was working on, or
when servers blew up, and I had trouble determining why.</p>

<p>He was a very logical person, and all three FUDCons that I have attended were
filled with evenings of him talking about anything from software, to food, to
philosophy. And he retained the quality of having very logical reasons for what
he was saying, each and every time.</p>

<p>But most of all, he was a good friend. Someone that I knew I could talk to if I
needed help with things. Someone who could make you feel better when you were
having a bad day. Someone who genuinely cared about me and my success.</p>

<p>Seth, I only knew you for 3 very short years, but I will sincerely miss you. You
were a great friend and community member, and words alone cannot express my
feelings of loss.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.elrod.me/blog/2012/07/11/python-flask-coming-to-epel-6/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-11T18:20:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.elrod.me/blog/2012/07/11/python-flask-coming-to-epel-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those not aware, I recently picked up the python-flask and python-werkzeug
packages, which were going to be orphaned.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the majority of today working on getting python-flask and its
dependencies working on EPEL 6, with Ian Weller.</p>

<p>The current plan is to get Flask 0.9 in EPEL right from the get-go.</p>

<p>There are two small patches we need to apply to the package to make using it
as painless as possible on RHEL environments. They both relate to telling
Flask to use the right Jinja2 package.</p>

<p>RHEL6-optional has Jinja 2.2.1. Flask requires 2.4 or greater. So we use the
EPEL version of Jinja2, <code>python-jinja2-26</code> which gives us Jinja 2.6. But we
need to tell Flask that it should import the 2.6 version, not the 2.2 version.</p>

<p>The other blocker is <code>python2-werkzeug</code> &mdash; the current EPEL 6 version of
werkzeug is 0.6.2. The plan there is to update that to 0.8.3, pending an
exemption of the Incompatible Upgrades Policy, at the EPEL meeting on Monday.</p>

<p>In any case, I just wanted to throw it out there that we are working on this
and we plan on having these pushed to EPEL soon. We&rsquo;re starting to develop
some custom apps with Flask, for use in the Fedora Infrastructure, so
this had to be done sooner or later.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

    <id>http://blog.elrod.me/blog/2012/06/04/elixir-language-is-now-in-fedora-17</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well it&rsquo;s been a week since my
<a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir language</a> package got
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=825418#c4">approved</a> and I am
happy to announce that it has been pushed to stable, and now appears in the
Fedora 17 updates repository.</p>

<p>Anyone who uses Fedora 17 or Fedora Rawhide, and wants to try out the new
programming language by Jos√© Valim (which runs on the Erlang VM), can simply:
<code>sudo yum install elixir</code></p>

<p>I might later on introduce an <code>elixir-git</code> subpackage for rawhide that tracks
Elixir&rsquo;s git repository more closely, but for now the <code>elixir</code> package tracks
the stable, currently 0.5.0 release, of Elixir.</p>

<p><code>elixir
iex&gt; IO.puts "Happy hacking!"
Happy hacking!
:ok
</code></p>

    <link href="http://blog.elrod.me/blog/2012/05/29/fedora-17-on-raspberry-pi/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-29T09:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.elrod.me/blog/2012/05/29/fedora-17-on-raspberry-pi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So about two weeks ago I received my
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve not had too
much time to actually play around with it. The day I got it I was leaving for
the <a href="http://hamvention.com">Dayton Hamvention</a>, so I had to get ready to go.</p>

<p>I had a few short hours that day, and did try out a few of the different
suggested distro images for the Pi. I first tried Fedora (the F14 remix),
then tried Debian, and I even tried Arch. They all worked (though I did have
problems with a large amount of packet loss among all of them, from the
ethernet port, but it seems to have worked itself out &mdash; might have been a
loose connection from the cable to the router).</p>

<p>After trying the various distros, I left for the Hamvention (taking it with me
to show off to my friends from the
<a href="http://www.w8upd.org">University of Akron Ham Radio Club</a>). But when I got
back home, it just pretty much stayed in its box. This is mostly because
I don&rsquo;t have an HDMI cable (I&rsquo;ll be ordering one next week), and so I have to
time playing with the Pi against my mom wanting to watch TV, and use the RCA
connector.</p>

<p>Well tonight I had an interesting idea. I was hanging out with
<a href="http://kg4sgp.com">KG4SGP</a> who is in from Virginia, and we were talking about
several projects, and where the Pi might fit into them.</p>

<p>When I got home from hanging out, I decided that it&rsquo;d be better to let my Pi
run just as a server that I can ssh into and play with, than just having it
sit in the box and doing nothing. I really do like the Pi, it&rsquo;s so awesome
that this little thing that can run off a USB port can run a full Linux
distro. I wanted to use it!</p>

<p>While I was at it, I decided I&rsquo;d try to get Fedora 17 on it. I grabbed the
<a href="http://scotland.proximity.on.ca/arm-nightlies/">latest F17 arm nightly</a>
(no X), flashed it to the SD card, got it booted in the Pi, set up static
networking, and got the Pi ssh-able. So now I have a Fedora 17 ARM playground.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://images.srv1.elrod.me/fedora-17-arm.png">http://images.srv1.elrod.me/fedora-17-arm.png</a>" title="&ldquo;htop&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>So &mdash; Yeah. This thing is cool. Time to play with the
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#GPIO_Driving_Example_.28Python.29">GPIO pins</a>
and make something cool!</p>
